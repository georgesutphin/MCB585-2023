## On Your Own

*In Class* we looked at visual/qualitative methods for assessing normality using histograms, density plots, and Q-Q plots. These remain the most common ways to make an initial assessment of normality before diving into statistical analysis. There are statistical tests for normality, and we will look at one of them, but these have caveats. The bottom line is this: it is *always* a good idea to look at how close your sample falls to the normal distribution. In the best case scenario, you can correct any deviations (see the section on transformations below). In the worst case you will be aware of any un-correctable deviations from normality and be in a position to apply an appropriate level of skepticism to P values that are borderline significant when a statistical test that makes the normality assumption is employed.

***
### The Shapiro-Wilk test for normality

While I will re-emphasize that it is *always* good to look at your data first, there is a statistical test for normality called the [Shapiro-Wilk test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapiro%E2%80%93Wilk_test), originally published in 1965. The Shapiro-Wilk test sets up the following hypotheses:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$$H_0$$: *The sample belongs to a normal distribution.*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$$H_1$$: *The sample does not belong to a normal distribution.*

In essence, the test looks for statistical deviation from the corresponding theoretical normal distribution. First, let's make sure we have our data loaded from the mouse diet study that we examined *In Class*: 

```{r}
data.diet <- read.delim("./data/b6.aj.hfhs.diet.txt")
b6 <- data.diet[data.diet$strain == "C57BL/6J",]
```

&nbsp;

We can run the Shapiro-Wilk test in R using the `shapiro.test()` function:

```{r eval=F}
?shapiro.test
```

&nbsp;

The only argument that we need to pass to the test is a numeric vector containing our data of interest:

```{r}
shapiro.test(b6$bw_start)
```

&nbsp; 

As we may have suspected from looking at the Q-Q plot and distributions *In Class*, the P-value is comfortably far from significance, and we can accept the null hypothesis that the sample is drawn from a normal distribution. As a demonstration, the exponential of this data is clearly not normal:

```{r}
qqnorm(exp(b6$bw_start))
qqline(exp(b6$bw_start))
shapiro.test(exp(b6$bw_start))
```

&nbsp;

Now that we have the tools, a question to consider: is it worth running a statistical test for normality?

### Transforming highly non-normal data

So what happens if your data is clearly non-normal? Let's look at plasma triglycerides for our C57BL/6 mice:

```{r}
qqnorm(b6$TG)
qqline(b6$TG)
shapiro.test(b6$TG)
```

&nbsp;

This sample looks to be clearly non-normal. In this case the data has a somewhat characteristic shape, with both low and values higher than expected from a normal distribution. What happens if we examine normality of the log of triglycerides?

```{r}
qqnorm(log(b6$TG))
qqline(log(b6$TG))
shapiro.test(log(b6$TG))
```

&nbsp;

That's much better! Now we can continue with our analysis using `log(b6$TG)` as our random variable, rather than the raw value of `b6$TG`. This is an ideal case, because taking the logarithm of a value is a *reversible* data transformation. We can easily reverse the process by raising `e` to the `log(b6$TG)` power (recall that by default, `log()` in R takes the natural logarithm of the input). Therefore, no information is lost when performing the transformation. Other reversible transformations include:
* square root: $$\sqrt{x}$$
* polynomial powers ($$x^2$$)
* inverse ($$\frac{1}{x}$$)
* exponential ($$e^x$$)

The best reversible transformation is not always immediately obvious. You can just try a few until you find the one that gives the most normal outcome. However, in some cases you won't be able to find a nice transformation that brings you closer to a normal distribution than you started with your raw data. You may also have outliers that are having an out-weighted effect. In these cases, you may need a more extreme measure. While we do not cover these options in detail, common approaches include using a [Z-Score Normalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_scaling#Standardization_(Z-score_Normalization)), a [Rank Z Transformation](https://rdrr.io/bioc/DOQTL/man/rankZ.html), or [Min-Max Scaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_scaling#Rescaling_(min-max_normalization)). These methods have different strengths and weaknesses, and tend to change some aspect of the data. For example, Min-Max Scaling suppresses the impact of outliers, while the Rank Z Transformation maintains data order, but forces a normal distribution and thus removes information about relative value.
