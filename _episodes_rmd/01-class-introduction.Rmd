### Introduction to R and RStudio

If we only had one data set to analyze, it would probably be faster to load the file into a spreadsheet, calculate some simple statisitcs, and generate a plot or two.

But what if we have twelve files to analyze in the same way? Or 100? 10,000? What if we are running an analysis that we will be repeating on future datasets?

**What is R?**

R is a statistical programming language widely used by working scientists that provides a broad spectrum of tools for data manipulation, statistical analysis, machine learning, graphical data representation, and more. R is one of the fastest growing programming languages and new tools are being created all the time. 

Advantages of R:
* **Versatility** -- You can do just about anything in the data analysis world.
* **Repeatability** -- Because R is a programming language, a properly designed script can be repeated and automated.
* **Community** -- Because R is widely used, there is a large and active online community producing resources, answering questions, and trying to solve new problems.

Disadvantages of R:
* **Learning Curve** -- R is a programming language. If you don't have programming experience, it can be a bit daunting to begin using. The major goal of this course is to guide you through the difficult first stage. At the end, we hope that you are familiar enough with the basic workings of R to be comfortable picking it up and try to apply it to new analysis problems in the future.
* **Slow for one-time operations** -- R is great of any analysis that you plan to perform more than once. Other tools are better for quick, one-time projects.

**What is RStudio?**

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It basically provides a convenient working environment for writing and employing R scripts. While you can work directly in the IDE provided with R, RStudio has a number of tools that make R easier to learn and interact with. We will be working exclusively in RStudio during this course.

***
### Installing R and RStudio

To participate in both in-class exercises and homework, you will need access to a computer with the current versions of the following installed:

1. [R software](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html)
2. [RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

You also need to download some files to follow along with the lessons in class:

1. Make a new folder in your Desktop called `MCB585`.
2. Download [MCB585-sample-data.zip]({{ page.root }}/data/MCB585-sample-data.zip)
   and move the file to this folder.
3. If it's not unzipped yet, double-click on it to unzip it. You should end up
   with a new folder called `data`.

&nbsp;
#### Using RStudio

Here are the basic elements of RStudio:

<img src="../fig/01-RStudio-overview.png" alt="RStudio Visual Interface" />

* Code and workflow are more reproducible if we can document everything that we do.
* Our end goal is not just to "do stuff" but to do it in a way that anyone can easily and exactly replicate our workflow and results.
* The best way to achieve this is to write scripts. RStudio provides an environment that allows you to do that.

&nbsp;
#### Interacting with R using RStudio

There are two main ways of interacting with R within RStudio: using the console or using script files (plain text files that contain your code).

**Console:** The console window (bottom left panel in RStudio) is the place where R is waiting for you to tell it what to do, and where it will show the results of a command.  You can type commands directly into the console, but they will be forgotten when you close the session. At some point in your analysis you may want to check the content of variable or the structure of an object, without necessarily keep a record of it in your script. You can type these commands directly in the console.

**Script:** The script window (top left panel) It is better to enter the commands in the script editor, and save the script. This way, you have a complete record of what you did, you can easily show others how you did it and you can do it again later on if needed. To run commands from script, you can either copy-paste them into the R console, or you can use the script window to 'send' the current line or the currently selected text to the R console using the following shortcut:
* iOS/Mac: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd>
* Windows: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>

There are many panels that provide useful information. In general, beyond **Script** and **Console**, we will spend time using the following panels:

**Environment:** The Environment panel (upper-right by default) provides a table with all variables currently loaded into memory, and their value (or type for more complex veriables). Clicking on a complex veriable will load a table in the Script panel showing the structure and values in that variable.

**Files:** The first tab on the lower-right panel provides a file explorer system that defaults to the working directory of the currently open R project (more on this later).

**Plots:** By default, any charts or graphics that you produce will be displayed in the Plots panel (second table of the lower-right panel).

**Help:** The Help tab on the lower-right panel let's you browse the built-in documentation for R functions. If you request documentation on a function (e.g. `?sum`), the help file will appear in this panel.

### Interacting with the console

If R is ready to accept commands, the R console shows a `>` prompt. If it receives a command (by typing, copy-pasting or sent from the script editor using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>, R will try to execute it, and when ready, show the results and come back with a new `>`-prompt to wait for new commands.

If R is still waiting for you to enter more data because the command you entered is not yet complete, the console will show a `+` prompt. This means that you haven't finished entering a complete command, perhaps because you haven't 'closed' a parenthesis or quotation. If you're in RStudio and this happens, either complete the command and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or click inside the console window and press <kbd>Esc</kbd> to cancel the current command. That should help you out of trouble.

&nbsp;
#### Basic commands

At the simplest level, the console can be used as a calculator to directly ask for basic operations. Try a few of the following:

*To run the command, try to copy-paste each line into the console and run. Also try copying/typing each line into the script, highlighting the text (or just make sure your cursor is on the right line), and pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>.*


```{r}
# Addition
40+2
```

```{r}
# Subtraction
98-56
```

```{r}
# Multiplication
6*7
```

```{r}
# Division
74088/1764
```

```{r}
# Exponential
6.480741^2
```

```{r}
# Equations with parenthetical operations
(((6 + 4) + 2)^2 + 9)/3 - 9
```

&nbsp;
#### Commenting

Note above the use of `#` signs to add comment. Comments are for you and anyone coming later to read your script. Anything to the right of a `#` is ignored by R. Comment liberally in your R scripts. We will discuss best practices in coding and the use of comments more later on in the course.

&nbsp;
#### Assigning values to variables

We can create a new variable and assign a value to it using `<-` or `=`, which are the assignment operators in R. It assigns values on the right to objects on
the left. So, after executing `x <- 3`, the value of `x` is `3`. The arrow can
be read as 3 *goes into* `x`.  You can also use `=` for assignments but not in
all contexts so it is good practice to use `<-` for assignments.

In RStudio, the <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>-</kbd> will write `<-` in a single keystroke. Let's give it a go:

```{r}
weight_kg <- 55   # using <- sets the value of the variable x to 42.
weight_kg = 55    # using `=` in place of `<-` works in almost all situation (but not quite all; it is better to get into the habit of using `<-`).
```

&nbsp;

Once a variable is created, we can use the variable name to refer to the value it was assigned. The variable name now acts as a tag. Whenever R reads that tag (`weight_kg`), it substitutes the value (`55`).

<img src="../fig/tag-variables.svg" alt="Variables as Tags" />

```{r}
# if you want to see the value of a variable, just type the variable name into the console:
weight_kg
```

&nbsp;

Also note that when you assign a value to a variable, a new object is created in the **Environment** panel (upper right). This panel lists all *objects* in your *workspace*. Note that whenever you make an assignment with `<-` or `=`, R creates a new object in memory. Your workspace is simply the collection of objects currently stored in memory that are available to access in your current R session.

Assigning a new value to a variable breaks the connection with the old value; R forgets that number and applies the variable name to the new value. 

When you assign a value to a variable, R only stores the value, not the calculation you used to create it. This is an important point if you're used to the way spreadsheet programs automatically updates linked cells. Let's look at an example.

First, we'll convert `weight_kg` into pounds, and store the new value in the variable `weight_lb`:

```{r}
# assign a weight in kg, then use it to calculate the weight in lbs
weight_kg <- 57.5
weight_lb <- 2.2 * weight_kg

# weight in kg...
weight_kg
# ...and in pounds
weight_lb
```
&nbsp;

We are asking R to look up the value we tagged `weight_kg`, multiply it by 2.2, and tag the result with the name `weight_lb`:

<img src="../fig/new-variables.svg" alt="Creating Another Variable" />

If we now change the value of `weight_kg`:

```{r}
weight_kg <- 100.0

# weight in kg now...
weight_kg
# ...and weight in pounds is still:
weight_lb
```

<img src="../fig/memory-variables.svg" alt="Updating a Variable" />

Since `weight_lb` doesn't "remember" where its value came from, it isn't automatically updated when `weight_kg` changes.

This is different from the way spreadsheets work.

&nbsp;
#### Incomplete commands

What happens if you don't complete a line?
```{r, eval=FALSE}
100 + 
```

&nbsp;

R hangs with a `+` in the console, waiting for you to finish your thought...

```{r}
1
```

&nbsp;

All better.

### Functions in R

Functions are predefined commands that take *input* values (aka [arguments]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#argument)), perform one or more operations, and generate a specific output. The format for using a function is:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
output <- functionX(argument1, argument2, ...)
```

&nbsp;

if the output variable and `<-` are not used, the output is written directly to your console window. Functions carry out a wide range of tasks, and some take no *arguments*. For example, `getwd()` will return the path to the current RStudio folder. We will talk more about folders and workspaces below.

```{r}
getwd()
```

&nbsp;

Other functions take many different *arguments*, separated by `,`s, that modify the output. For example, the `sum()` function will output the sum of all numeric input arguments:

```{r}
sum(1,2,6)
```

&nbsp;

Functions can also be nested. For example, let's combine the `sum()` and `sqrt()` (short for "square root") functions to add up the square roots of 4, 9, and 16:

```{r}
sum(sqrt(4), sqrt(9), sqrt(16))
```

***
### Working directories in R

Your *working directory* refers to the file path on your computer where the current session of R will go to look for files. You need to have any external data that you are working with in a file in your working directory in order to load it into R (or know how to specify a different location, if it isn't in your working directory). Any output (data or charts) that you save in R will also be stored in the working directory by default unless you specify a different location on your computer. 

A collection of scripts and data in R are defined as a *Project*. Among other things, the project will define the default working directory. Let's try staring a new project:

1. In RStudio, click **File > New Project...**.
2. Click **Existing Directory**.
3. Click <kbd>Browse...</kbd>.
4. Navigate to your *MCB585* folder and click <kbd>Create Project</kbd>.

RStudio will reload with a clean working environment. If you click on the **Files** tab (lower right panel), you will see that the current folder is your *MCB585* folder, and that RStudio will have created a new file called **MCB585.Rproj**.

In the future, you can either just open this file from your file explorer to load you MCB585 project, or you can open it from RStudio by clicking **File > Open Project...**, navigating to your *MCB585* folder, and selecting the **MCB585.Rproj** file.

You can change the active working directly by using the function `setwd()`. For example, we can set the working directory to your *MCB585/data* folder using one of the following commands:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd("./data")
setwd("data")
```

&nbsp;

To return the working directory to your *MCB585* folder, enter the following command:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd("..") 
```

&nbsp;

Note that unless you specify the entire path, all entries will be relative to the current working directory. Relative navigation:
* '.' = the current working directory
* '..' = the directory one level above the working directory (i.e. the Desktop in our case)
* Note that "./data" and "data" both mean "go to the *data* folder inside the current working directory"

If you are unsure what your current working directory is, you can define the entire path:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd("C:/Users/<username>/Desktop/MCB585/data") # Windows
setwd("/Users/<username>/Desktop") # MacOS
```

**Caution for Windows users:** If you copy a file path from Windows Explorer and paste it into `setwd()`, you have to change the backslashes ("\\") used in Windows to forwardslashes ("/"). R interprets "\\" as a special type of character called an *escape character* rather than a part of the string. If you don't replace them, you will get errors:

&nbsp;

```{r}
setwd(".\data")
```

&nbsp;

We can also ask R what the current working directory is using `getwd()`, and ask for a list of files in the current directly with `list.files()`:

```{r}
# Retrieve the current working directory
getwd()
```

```{r}
# List all files in the current working directory
list.files()
```

&nbsp;
> ## Be careful when using `setwd()`
>
> One should exercise caution when using `setwd()`. Changing directories in the middle of a script file can limit reproducibility:
> * `setwd()` will return an error if the directory to which you're trying to change doesn't exist or if the user doesn't have the correct permissions to access that directory. This becomes a problem when sharing scripts between users who have organized their directories differently.
> * If/when your script terminates with an error, you might leave the user in a different directory than the one they started in, and if they then call the script again, this will cause further problems. If you must use `setwd()`, it is best to put it at the top of the script to avoid these problems.
> 
> The following error message indicates that R has failed to set the working directory you specified:
>
> ```
> Error in setwd("~/path/to/working/directory") : cannot change working directory
> ```
> 
> It is best practice to have the user running the script begin in a consistent directory on their machine and then use relative file paths from that directory to access files (see below).

### Getting help

Stuck? The *On Your Own* section will provide a more extensive list of places where you can look for answers to questions about R and RStudio. For today, we will emphasize the two best ways.

&nbsp;
#### R documentation

For help with functions, the first place to look is in the R documentation. Use `?<function name>` to read the basic instructions for using a function. Try it with a function we have already used, `sqrt()`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?sqrt # note that you don't include the () after sqrt for help
```

The documentation gives you a **Description** of the purpose of the function. **Usage** tells you the basic information about what *arguments* the function is expecting, and the **Arguments** section describes each argument. At the very end, most functions include several **Examples** demonstrating usage. 

Note that if you don't know the name of a function, you can run a more general search using `??"<search term>"`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
??"square root"
```

&nbsp;
Unfortunately, this is not a very sophisticated search and often returns many unhelpful results without actually finding the obvious function. Usually I just turn to the next solution:

&nbsp;
#### Google is your friend

There is a vibrant and active R programming community out there. If you have a question, chances are someone has already answered it online somewhere. I have been using R extensively for nearly a decade, and have only twice been unable to find solutions to even obscure and complex problems.

Become adept at using online search engines to locate solutions. I usually start with "r <question>". Getting the phrasing right can be a bit tricky. Let's give it a try:
