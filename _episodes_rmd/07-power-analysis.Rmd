Increasingly, funding agencies are asking for detailed justification for experimental design decisions. An explicitly request in these requirements is presentation of a power analysis to justify your study design, particularly your selected sample size.

So what is power analysis? In essence, power analysis is a structured process for thinking through critical aspects of an upcoming question to ensure that your study is properly designed to test your hypothesis. The name "Power Analysis"" comes from the statistical definition of power:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*The power of a statistical test is the probability that it will reject the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true.*

The power of a test depends on several factors, including the characteristics of the observed phenotype in a population, the expected difference between groups, and the size of the sample. As we will see, sample size is the primary tool that we have to adjust power. For this reason, the usual goal of conducting a power analysis is to determine the sample size needed to test a specific hypothesis with a given statistical test. 

***
### The conceptual basis for power analysis

There are several possible outcomes when we collect a sample and run a statistical test to evaluate a hypothesis. There is some truth about our population that we are trying to detect: either the null hypothesis is true, or the alternative hypothesis is true. Once we conduct our test, there are two possible outcomes: either we accept the null hypothesis, or we reject it in favor of the alternative hypothesis. We can lay out the possible scenarios in a table:

Truth Table | $$H_0$$ True | $$H_1$$ True
----------: | :----------: | :----------:
Accept $$H_0$$ | Correct | Type II Error ($$\beta$$)
Reject $$H_0$$ | Type I Error ($$\alpha$$) | Correct

Each quadrant has specific meaning to our experiment. 
1. The upper left quadrant is the boring case where there is no difference present, and correctly conclude that this is the case.
2. Type I Error ($$\alpha$$). In the lower left is the probability that we make an error and reject the null hypothesis when it is, in fact, true. 
3. Type II Error ($$\beta$$). In the upper right is the probability that we make an error and accept the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true. 
4. Power (1 - $$\beta$$). Finally, in the lower right we have the situation where we correctly reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative when the alternative is, in fact, true. The probability associated with this outcome is called **power**. Because the top and bottom possibility in each column are direct negations, the sum of probabilities in each column is 1. Therefore:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;power = 1 - $$\beta$$

While we cannot eliminate the possibility of committing either type of error, a well-designed experiment will explicitly define the chance of committing either a Type I or Type II Error. 

**Limiting Type I Errors.** Because the P-value represents the probability that the observed sample mean came from the null sampling distribution, it tells us directly what our chance of committing a Type I Error. Thus, we generally control Type I Errors explicitly by choosing a value for $$\alpha$$ and only accepting P-values that fall below that threshold. 

**Limiting Type II Errors.** Type II Errors are simply a failure to detect a real difference when once exists. Because they are not explicitly built into the statistical testing process like the $$\alpha$$ threshold used to control Type I Errors, they often go uncontrolled and unremarked upon. Deliberately controlling Type II Errors requires more work up front in careful study design. As we will see, there are a couple of options here, but the main one is in the selection of sample size.

To better understand these concepts, let's look at them visually by examining our distributions. To set up our thought experiment, we want to consider the situation where a real difference exists (because this is what we are ultimately interested in detecting):

<img src="../fig/power.png" alt="Power Analysis" />

&nbsp;

The sampling means for two distributions are separated by some distance ($$\Delta$$). The variance in the distribution defines what fraction of the distributions overlap.

The dotted vertical line represents our selected P-value threshold ($$\alpha$$): if the sample mean from the compared sample falls within the threshold (between the dotted lines), we accept the null hypothesis. If it falls outside the threshold, we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative. $$\alpha$$ is visually represented as the area under the distribution curve of the null distribution that falls outside the threshold mean. 

In contrast to $$\alpha$$, the $$\beta$$ represents the fraction of the area of the second distribution that falls within the threshold sample means. If a measured sample mean falls within this range, we will erroneously accept the null hypothesis (the distributions are the same) when the alternative hypothesis (the means are different, as drawn) is true. 

***
### What variables are important for minimizing error?

What are the key features of the above distributions that can be manipulated to control our two types of error? As noted above, we control $$\alpha$$ directly by setting our desired value as the P-value threshold (or significance level). Looking at the above distributions, it turns out that we have five features that are inter-dependent:
* **Population standard deviations:** $$\sigma_1$$, $$\sigma_2$$
* **Sample size:** $$n_1$$, $$n_2$$
* **Effect size:** This is the minimum difference in means that we would like to detect, and has two common symbolic representations.
 + **Difference in means:** $$\Delta = \mu_2 - \mu_1$$
 + **Cohen's *d*:** $$d = \frac{\sqrt{2}*(\mu_2 - \mu_1)}{\sqrt{\sigma_1^2 + \sigma_2^2}}$$. 
* **Significance level:** $$\alpha$$
* **Power:** $$1 - \beta$$

*If we know 4, we can calculate the 5th.* This means that we can define our desired $$\alpha$$ and $$\beta$$ if we can control the other 3. 

Two of these remaining variables are generally defined by biological features of our system:
* Effect size is determined by what change in sampling mean represents a biologically meaningful difference. This will vary widely based on the phenotype that you are interested in (e.g. a 10% increase in lifespan may be something to celebrate, while a 2-fold change in transcript level may be borderline for relevance for gene expression).
* The population standard deviation is a feature of your phenotype of interest.

That leaves **sample size** as our only real tool to control error terms. Since we typically set $$\alpha$$ to 0.05 by convention, what we are left with is a direct relatinship between power and sample size. By examining the impact of sample size on the distribution shapes and relationships, we can see how this relationship holds:

<img src="../fig/power-sample-size.png" alt="Power Analysis" />

&nbsp;

By increasing sample size we reduce the variance in the sampling distribution. For a given population with a specified $$\Delta$$ and $$\alpha$$, this reduces the overlap in the sampling distributions, reducing the probability of making a Type II Error ($$\beta$$) and increasing the power to detect a real difference in distribution means, if one exists.

In reality, effect size is another parameter that can be manipulated in the effort to maximize power while minimizing resource expenditure. You might, for instance, decide opt for a larger power to detect a bigger effect size. The interplay between these various factors can be intuitively manipulated using a visualization tool at [R Psychologist](http://rpsychologist.com/d3/NHST/).

### Calculating power in R

The `pwr` package in R has power analysis tools for the t-test and a number of other statistical tests. Let's explore the t-test power tool using our mouse body weight data. First, let's install and load the package, and load our data set:

```{r}
# install and load "pwr" package
install.packages("pwr")
library("pwr")

# load high-fat high-sucrose mouse diet data
data.diet <- read.delim("./data/b6.aj.hfhs.diet.txt")
```

The power t-test function is `pwr.t.test()`. Let's examine the inputs first:

```{r, eval=F}
?pwr.t.test
```

The function requires n (sample size), d (Cohen's d effect size, which incorporates mean and standard deviation), significance level ($$\alpha$$), and power (1 - $$\beta$$), as well as two arguments that define the type of t-test (we generally want `type = "two.sample"` and `alternative = "two.sided"`). You can actually calculate any of the first 4. Just enter any three, and set the desired output to `NULL`.

For our purposes, we want to determine the sample size needed to detect a 20% change in body weight with 95% power at a 0.05 significance level in C57BL/6J mice.


First, recall that the data is close to normal: 

```{r}
qqnorm(data.diet$bw_start[data.diet$strain == "C57BL/6J"])
qqline(data.diet$bw_start[data.diet$strain == "C57BL/6J"])
```

&nbsp;


```{r}
# define our desired parameters:
power = 0.95   # we want a 95% chance
beta = 1 - power
change = 0.2 # to detect a 20% change in body weight
alpha = 0.05   # at a 0.05 significance level 

# we next use our available data to estimate the distribution shape parameters (mean, sd)
mu = mean(data.diet$bw_start[data.diet$strain == "C57BL/6J"])
sigma = sd(data.diet$bw_start[data.diet$strain == "C57BL/6J"])

# from the mean and the desired percent change we can calculate the effect size
delta = change*mu
  
# calculate Cohen's d; since we are assuming that standard deviation is not affected, 
# this just collapses to:
d = delta/sigma

# calculate sample size, enter the other values
n.t = pwr.t.test(n=NULL,d=delta/sigma,sig.level=alpha,power=power,type="two.sample",alternative="two.sided")
n.t$n
```

&nbsp;

So, we only need to test ~7 mice per groups to detect a 20% change in body weight for C57BL/6J mice.

### Using t-test power analysis in non-normal populations to calculate minimum sample size

What about data that does not meet the normality assumption of the t-test? There are more sophisticated ways to handle this type of data, which we will discuss next week, but the t-test power calculation is much simpler and still gives a good ballpark estimate. In face, this is probably the most common method for running power analyses in non-normal data, despite the violation of the normality assumption. The estimate that it gives is still useful, just treat sample size estimates as *bare minimum* numbers, at best.

To illustrate, let's say we want to move to the next step and determine the impact of high-fat high-sucrose diet on mouse lifespan. Design an experiment to determine whether the high-fat, high- sucrose diet affects lifespan in C57BL/6J. We need to detect a 20% change in lifespan at 95% power. We have pilot lifespan data from a published inbred strain survey study in the file `inbred.lifespan.txt`.

First load the data and take a look:
```{r}
# load data
data.surv <- read.delim("./data/inbred.lifespan.txt")

# summarize data structure and examine strain list
str(data.surv)
unique(data.surv$strain) # generate strain list

# grab subset of lifespan data for C57BL/6J mice.
surv.b6 = data.surv[data.surv$strain %in% "C57BL/6J",]

```

Okay, we are in business. Let's see if the data is normal.

```{r}
qqnorm(surv.b6$lifespan_days)
qqline(surv.b6$lifespan_days)

```

&nbsp;

That actually looks pretty good for survival data. Certainly good enough that we don't need to worry too much about normality assumptions, but we should still treat our t-test samples sizes conservatively, since survival data violates other t-test assumptions.

```{r}
# set desired power and significance
alpha = 0.05
power = 0.95
beta = 1 - power
change = 0.2

# we next use our pilot data to estimate the distribution shape parameters (mean, sd)
mu = mean(surv.b6$lifespan_days)
sigma = sd(surv.b6$lifespan_days)

# from the mean and the desired percent change we can calculate the effect size
delta = change*mu

# t-test
n.t = pwr.t.test(n=NULL,d=delta/sigma,sig.level=alpha,power=power,type="two.sample",alternative="two.sided")
n.t$n
```
 
 &nbsp;
 
 That's much bigger than the sample size needed for body weight! Lifespan data has a much higher variability than body weight data, so a similar detection change requires a bigger sample size to achieve the same power at the same significance level.

### Generating power reference charts

The previous examples give us an idea of what to expect when we have a clear idea about our desired effect size, power, and significance level going in. Okay, so we know that with 30 C57BL/6J mice per group, we have 95% power to detect a 20% change. But what power do we have to detect a 30% change? How much do we need to increase the sample size to have the same power to detect a 10% change?

It is often useful, particularly in early-stage planning, to have an idea of what the relationship looks like between sample size, power, and effect size. We can plot these by repeating the power analysis to calculate sample size requirements over a range of power values.

```{r}
# set desired change and significance
alpha = 0.05
change = 0.2

# we next use our pilot data to estimate the distribution shape parameters (mean, sd)
mu = mean(surv.b6$lifespan_days)
sigma = sd(surv.b6$lifespan_days)

# from the mean and the desired percent change we can calculate the effect size
delta = change*mu

# set up a vector with a range of values for power
power.vec = seq(0.5,0.99,0.01)

# initialize an empty vector with the same length as power where we will store calculated
# sample size values
n.vec = numeric(length = length(power.vec))

# cycle through all power values using a for loop
# and calculate n for each
for (i.pwr in 1:length(power.vec)) {
  # grab the current power value
  power.c = power.vec[i.pwr]
  
  # display current iteration
  print(paste("Calculating n for power",power.c))
  
  # calculate sample size for current power
  pwr.test.c = pwr.t.test(n=NULL,d=delta/sigma,sig.level=alpha,power=power.c,
                         type="two.sample",alternative="two.sided")
  
  # save value to sample size vector
  n.vec[i.pwr] = pwr.test.c$n
}

# visualize the relationship between power and animal number
plot(n.vec,power.vec, type = "l", 
     ylab = "Power to detect 20% change in lifespan", xlab = "# Animals Required")
```

&nbsp;

The relationship between sample size and power is not linear. This chart gives a good illustration about how sample size has diminishing returns when trying to improve power. Increasing sample size from 10 to 20 gives you a %30% boost in power, while increasing sample size from 20 to 30 only gives an additional ~12%.

We can go a step farther and look at the relationship between effect size, power, and sample size:

```{r}
# set desired significance
alpha = 0.05

# we next use our pilot data to estimate the distribution shape parameters (mean, sd)
mu = mean(surv.b6$lifespan_days)
sigma = sd(surv.b6$lifespan_days)

# Define vectors containing the range of effect size and power that we are interested in
change.vec = seq(0.1,0.3,0.01)
power.vec = c(0.5,0.8,0.9,0.95)

# initialize a numeric matrix of the proper size to capture different effect sizes (in rows)
# and powers (in columns)
n.mat = matrix(NA, nrow = length(change.vec), ncol = length(power.vec))

# cycle through all power and change values using a for loop
# and calculate n for each
for (i.pwr in 1:length(power.vec)) {
  # grab current value for power
  power.c = power.vec[i.pwr]
  
  # print current step
  print(paste("Calculating sample size for power",power.c))
  
  for (i.change in 1:length(change.vec)) {
    # grab the current effect size
    change.c = change.vec[i.change]
    
    # calculate delta from mu and current change value
    delta.c = change.c*mu
    
    # calculate sample size for current power
    pwr.test.c = pwr.t.test(n=NULL,d=delta.c/sigma,sig.level=alpha,power=power.c,
                     type="two.sample",alternative="two.sided")
    
    # save value to sample size vector
    n.mat[i.change, i.pwr] = pwr.test.c$n
  }

}

# list colors for plot
col.list = c("black","blue","green","red")

# setup the plot limits to include all
x.lim = c(min(100*change.vec),max(100*change.vec))
y.lim = c(min(n.mat),max(n.mat))

# initialize empty plot with defined limits 
plot(NA, xlim = x.lim, ylim = y.lim, 
     xlab = "% Change in Lifespan", ylab = "# Animals Required",
     main = "Power analysis for C57BL/6J Lifespan, p < 0.05")

# add a legend for the power values
legend("topright", legend = power.vec, fill = col.list, title="Power")

# finally, add a separate line for each power level
for (i.pwr in 1:length(power.vec)) {
  lines(100*change.vec,n.mat[,i.pwr], col = col.list[i.pwr])
}
```
