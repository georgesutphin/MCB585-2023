###  On Your Own

#### Conditional statements -- additional detail

We covered the basics of using `if` and `else` statement *In Class*. These make up a central tool in coding. There are a lot of ways to write the logical tests in `if` statements to ask specific and complex questions about your data and metadata. Here is a useful reference to help keep the options straight:

### Using `for` loops -- additional detail

&nbsp;
#### Setting up the loop variable in `for` loops -- two common approaches

There is a subtle decision to make when designing a `for` loop. *In Class* we demonstrated how to use the **loop variable** to step through a collection of objects and repeat some desired task. R updates the **loop variable** during each *loop* (aka each *iteration*) by reassigning the value of the **loop variable** to the next object sequentially in the collection. However, we can use different properties of the collection to define the value assigned to the **loop variable** during each iteration. The two most common are to have the **loop variable** take on, in sequence:
 * the value of the object contained within each element, or
 * the position (i.e. index) of the element within the collection

Each is perfectly acceptable, and useful in different situations.

&nbsp;

**Iterating by element**

Updating the **loop variable** to take on the value of the next element in the collection during each iteration is the version we used in *in class*. To do this, we define the **loop variable** using the format `for(item in collection)`. To illustrate what the loop is doing with the **loop variable** during each iteration, let's write a self-referential `for` loop that just prints the value of the **loop variable** once each loop. We will use the first 6 letters in the alphabet as our `collection`:

```{r}
# define our collection
collection <- letters[1:6]
collection

# iterate through the collection and print each element
for(item in collection) {
  print(item)
}

```

&nbsp;

we can now use the values contained within our `collection` in operations within the loop. As an arbitraty example, we can add the letters to a growing string and print that string:


```{r}
string <- "" # initialize empty string
for(item in collection) {
  print(item) # print current item
  string <- paste0(string,item) # add letter to current string
  print(string) # print current string
}
```

&nbsp;

This structure for the `for` loop is important when all you need to manipulate within the loop are the values contained within the collection. 

&nbsp;

**Iterating by position**

Often times, there will be a good reason to know the current position (or index) in the collection during a given loop, rather than the contents of the collection at that position. The index allows us to do a variety of things, including index other objects with the same dimensions or provide the user with a progress update for more time consuming jobs. T

For positional indexing, we can use the format `for(1:length(collection))`. Alternatively, we can use the `seq_along()` function, which is a version of seq that uses arguments `from = 1` and `by = 1` by default, and the length of the entered object for the `to` argument. Thus `1:length(collection)` produces the same result as `seq_along(collection)`:

```{r}
collection
1:length(collection)
seq_along(collection)
```

&nbsp;

In essence, we are creating a new `collection` for the `for` loop that consists of a list of integers from 1 to the length of the collection. The `for` loop will step through these integers, in effect using the `loop` variable too keep count of the number of loops that have progressed. Let't look at the behavior by replacing the **loop** variable from our above example with the positional version (and renaming `item` with `i` to indicate that we are looking at the index, rather than the contents, of `collection`:

```{r}
for(i in 1:length(collection)) {
  print(i)
}
```

&nbsp;

Note that we can still easily grab the contents of `collection` in each loop by simply indexing it with our **loop variable**:

```{r}
for(i in 1:length(collection)) {
  print(collection[i])
}
```

&nbsp;

Because we can easily grab the current element of `collection` in this way, and the current index is more generally useful than the content of the current collection element, I tend to use **positional iteration** in `for` loops by default. This one comes down to personal preference. 

One place that **positional iteration** is commonly useful is when you want to use a `for` loop to repeat some operation on each row of a **data frame**. Let's revisit our aneurism data set:

```{r}
dat <- read.csv("data/sample.csv")
head(dat)
```

&nbsp;

Recall that in earlier lessons we corrected the capitalization inconsistency in the `Gender` variable, and also calculated several summary statistics for the quarterly aneurisms counts (total, mean, maximum). We previously did these using a combination of vectorized functions and the `apply()` function. Let's look at how we might accomplish the same set of tasks using a `for` loop:

```{r}
# first define a new empty column for each new statistic 
# that we want to calculate; use NAs to indicate no value
# has yet been calculated
dat$aneurisms_total <- NA
dat$aneurisms_mean <- NA
dat$aneurisms_max <- NA

# set up a for loop to cycle through each row of the data frame
# using the number of rows provided by the dim() function; you 
# could alternatively use 1:length(dat$ID) for example
for(i in 1:dim(dat)[1]) {
  # first use an if statements to correct lower to upper case Gender
  # for the current (ith) entry
  if(dat$Gender[i] == "m") {dat$Gender[i] <- "M"} # do nothing if not "m"
  if(dat$Gender[i] == "f") {dat$Gender[i] <- "F"} # do nothing if not "f"
  
  # now calculate the current (ith) value for each of the statistics;
  # note that we need to include `as.numeric()` to tell R to treat
  # the columns of the data frame instead as a numeric vector
  dat$aneurisms_total[i] <- sum(as.numeric(dat[i,6:9]))
  dat$aneurisms_mean[i] <- sum(as.numeric(dat[i,6:9]))
  dat$aneurisms_max[i] <- sum(as.numeric(dat[i,6:9]))
}

# check the result
head(dat)

```

&nbsp;

In this case, the point is more illustrative of how to design a `for` loop. Using `toupper()` to correct the `Gender` column and 3 `apply()` statements to take care of the statistics would accomplish in 4 lines of code what too 11 in the `for` loop version. However, there will be times when the analysis you want to conduct is too complex to formulate concisely within an `apply()` statement or two. 


&nbsp;
#### `for` or `apply`?

A `for` loop is used to apply the same function calls to a collection of objects. As we just demonstrated, the `apply` family of functions are used in much the same way.

You've already used one of the family, `apply()`. The `apply` family members include:
 * `apply()`  - apply over the margins of an array (e.g. the rows or columns of a matrix)
 * `lapply()` - apply over an object and return list
 * `sapply()` - apply over an object and return a simplified object (an array) if possible
 * `vapply()` - similar to `sapply()` but you specify the type of object returned by the iterations
 * Functions provided in external packages, such as `ddply()` and `adply()` in the popular `dplyr` package.

Each of these has an argument `FUN` (or something similar) which takes a function to apply to each element of the object. Instead of looping over `filenames` and calling `analyze`, as you did earlier, you could `sapply` over `filenames` with `FUN = analyze`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
sapply(filenames, FUN = analyze)
```

Deciding whether to use `for` or one of the `apply` family is really personal preference. Using an `apply` family function forces to you encapsulate your operations as a function rather than separate calls with `for`. `for` loops are often more intuitive. For several related operations, a `for` loop will avoid you having to pass in a lot of extra arguments to your function.

You will sometimes see claims that `apply` functions run faster than a `for` loop designed to run the same operations. However, this is not generally true, and under the surface the `apply` functions are just convenient wrappers for a hidden `for` loops.

&nbsp;
#### Loops in R are slow (??)

On this topic, you will probably also hear at some point if you keep using R that loops are slow. This is a common refrain in coding forums. In point of fact, loops are not slow *if* you follow a few guidelines:
 1. Don't use a loop when a vectorized alternative exists; unlike `apply`, vectorized operations *are* faster than loops
 2. Don't grow objects (via `c()`, `cbind()`, etc) during the loop - R has to create a new object and copy across the information just to add a new element or row/column
 3. Instead, pre-allocate an empty object that is large enough to hold the results (e.g. a **data frame** with the right number of rows and columns, but with `NA` or default values pre-loaded) and fill in the individual values during each iteration of the `for` loop. For instance, in the aneurisms example above, we pre-defined (aka initialized) empty columns in the data frame for the total, mean, and max statistics *before* starting the `for` loop.

As an example, we will create a new function called `analyze()` that will return the mean inflammation per day (column) of each file in the inflammation dataset that we examined earlier. We will start by breaking rule 2, and grow our output by adding new data to a growing data frame using `cbind()`:

```{r}
analyze <- function(filenames) {
  
  # start by defining the loop parameters
  for (f in seq_along(filenames)) {
    fdata <- read.csv(filenames[f], header = FALSE)
    res <- apply(fdata, 2, mean)
    
    # check if this is the first iteration
    if (f == 1) {
      # if so, the current result is the only line of output
      out <- res
    } else {
      # If this is not the first iteration, add the result to the
      # established result as a new column
      out <- cbind(out, res)
    }
  }
  return(out)
}
```

&nbsp;

Note how we add a new column to `out` during each iteration? This is a cardinal sin of writing a `for` loop in R.

A much better practice is to create an empty matrix with the right dimensions (rows/columns) to hold the results before starting the `for` loop. Then we loop over the files as before, but this time we fill in the pre-defined `f`th column of our results matrix `out` instead of creating a new column from scratch on the fly. This time there is no copying/growing for R to deal with.

```{r}
analyze2 <- function(filenames) {
  # pre-allocate the right number of rows and columns for the data
  out <- matrix(ncol = length(filenames), nrow = 40) 
  
  # run the for loop to cycle through the files
  for (f in seq_along(filenames)) {
    # read the current file 
    fdata <- read.csv(filenames[f], header = FALSE)
    
    # instead of using cbind, now we just overwrite the row of 
    # the pre-allocated matrix
    out[, f] <- apply(fdata, 2, mean)
  }
  return(out)
}
```

&nbsp;

Now we can use the function `system.time()` to find out how long it takes to run each of these functions:

```{r}
# First, make sure our inflammation file list is defined
inflam.files <- list.files(path = "data", 
                         pattern = "^inflammation-.*.csv$",
                         full.names = TRUE)

gc() # clean things up first

# one call to each function does not always show the difference. To 
# demonstrate the point, we will use a for loop to call function 100
# times in a row to see how long each takes
system.time(avg <- for(i in 1:100) {analyze(inflam.files)})
system.time(avg <- for(i in 1:100) {analyze2(inflam.files)})
```

&nbsp;

The `system` time output indicates the total CPU time used to execute the function with `elapsed` reflects the total real-world time consumed between when the function was called and when the output was generated. Your results may vary from run to run, but the amount of time used by `analyze` should always be greater than the time used by `analyze2`, all else being equal. A few 10ths of a second may not seem much now, but keep in mind that we are running a few simple operations on a few hundred files in total. As the complexity of your analysis and the number of files or data point in your dataset increases, the time difference will increase dramatically. A given analysis taking 6 hours to process vs. 30 hours can be critical to the success of some big-data projects, even before you start to calculate the monetary expense of running large analyses on a super computer. This demonstrates one way to evaluate efficiency when it starts to matter.

Note that `apply` handles these memory allocation issues for you, but then you have to write the loop part as a function to pass to `apply`. At its heart, `apply` is just a `for` loop with extra convenience.

> ## Gathering data
> 
> There is interest in examining the inflammation data in a more complete analysis.
> To examine effects of treatments across trials, we first need to collect our data
> into a single file. 
> 
> Gather all of the data from the various inflammation files into a single data frame
> with the appropriate labels indicating where each data point originated. Make sure
> that your script is robust enough to run on any number of inflammation data files.
