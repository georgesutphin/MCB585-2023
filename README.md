MCB585: Multidisciplinary/Quantitative Approaches to Solving Biological Problems
================================================================================

MCB585 is a graduate course in the Department of Molecular & Cellular Biology at the University of Arizona designed to teach quantitative approaches to biological questions. The Fall 2019 version of the course is presented in two parts. Part 1 will cover practical applied biostatistics, while Part 2 will cover techniques to manipulate large datasets, with an emphasis on extracting and manipulating image data. The R Statistical Programing language will be employed throughout the course both as a teaching tool, and to develop an independent skill in a tool for approaching a wide range of data problems in biology.

The basic design of the course presentation is based on [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), which teach foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide. The couse instructors are:

* [George Sutphin](https://sutphinlab.org/) (sutphin@email.arizona.edu)
* [Andrew Paek](http://paeklab.mcb.arizona.edu/) (apaek@email.arizona.edu)
